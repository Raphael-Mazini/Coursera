**Question 1**. Which of the following is NOT a data quality issue?

* Duplicate data

* **Scaled data**

* Inconsistent data

* Missing values


**Question 2**. Imputing missing data means to

* replace missing values with outliers.

* merge samples with missing values.

* **replace missing values with something reasonable.**

* drop samples with missing values.


**Question 3**. A data sample with values that are considerably different than the rest of the other data samples in the dataset is called an/a _____________.

* Inconsistent data

* Noise

* **Outlier**

* Invalid data


**Question 4**. Which one of the following examples illustrates the use of domain knowledge to address a data quality issue?

* **Merge duplicate records while retaining relevant data**

* Drop samples with missing values

* Simply discard the samples that lie significantly outside the distribution of your data

* None of these


**Question 5**. Which of the following is NOT an example of feature selection?

* Re-formatting an address field into separate street address, city, state, and zip code fields.

* **Replacing a missing value with the variable mean.**

* Adding an in-state feature based on an applicant's home state.

* Removing a feature with a lot of missing values.


**Question 6**. Which one of the following is the best feature set for your analysis?

* **Feature set with the smallest set of features that best capture the characteristics of the data for the intended application**

* Feature set with the largest number of features

* Feature set with the smallest number of features

* Feature set that contains exclusively re-coded features


**Question 7**. The mean value and the standard deviation of a zero-normalized feature are

* mean = 0 and standard deviation = 0

* mean = 1 and standard deviation = 0

* mean = 1 and standard deviation = 1

* **mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1**


**Question 8**. Which of the following is NOT true about PCA?

* PCA stands for principal component analysis

* PC1, the first principal component , captures the largest amount of variance in the data along a single dimension.

* PC1 and PC2, the first and second principal components, respectively, are always orthogonal to each other.

* **PCA is a dimensionality reduction technique that removes a feature that is very correlated with another feature.**
