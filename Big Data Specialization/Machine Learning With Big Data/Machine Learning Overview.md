## Machine Learning Overview
<br>

_Correct answers are in **bold**._
<br>

**Question 1**. What is NOT machine learning?

* Discover hidden patterns

* **Explicit, step-by-step programming**

* Data-driven decisions

* Learning from data


**Question 2**. Which of the following is NOT a category of machine learning?

* Association Analysis

* Cluster Analysis

* Classification

* Regression

* **Algorithm Prediction**


**Question 3**. Which categories of machine learning techniques are supervised?

* classification and cluster analysis

* cluster analysis and association analysis

* **classification and regression**

* regression and association analysis


**Question 4**. In unsupervised approaches,

* the target is provided.

* **the target is unknown or unavailable.**

* the target is unlabeled.

* the target is what is being predicted.


**Question 5**. What is the sequence of the steps in the machine learning process?

* Prepare -> Acquire -> Analyze -> Report -> Act

* Acquire -> Prepare -> Analyze -> Act -> Report

* Prepare -> Acquire -> Analyze -> Act -> Report

* **Acquire -> Prepare -> Analyze -> Report -> Act**


**Question 6**. Are the steps in the machine learning process apply-once or iterative?

* Apply-once

* **Iterative**

* The first two steps, Acquire and Prepare, are apply-once, and the other steps are iterative.


**Question 7**. Phase 2 of CRISP-DM is Data Understanding. In this phase,

* we prepare the data for analysis.

* **we acquire as well as explore the data that is related to the problem.**

* we define the problem or opportunity to be addressed.


**Question 8**. What is the main difference between KNIME and Spark MLlib?

* **KNIME is a graphical user interface-based machine learning tool, while Spark MLlib provides a programming-based distributed platform for scalable machine learning algorithms.**

* KNIME requires programming in Java, while Spark MLlib requires programming in Python.

* KNIME requires programming, while Spark MLlib does not.

* KNIME originated in Germany, while Spark MLlib was created in California, USA.
