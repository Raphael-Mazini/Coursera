**Question 1**. What is the main difference between classification and regression?

* **In classification, you're predicting a category, and in regression, you're predicting a number.**

* There is no difference since you're predicting a numeric value from the input variables in both tasks.

* In classification, you're predicting a number, and in regression, you're predicting a category.

* In classification, you're predicting a categorical variable, and in regression, you're predicting a nominal variable.


**Question 2**. Which of the following is NOT an example of regression?

* **Determining whether power usage will rise or fall**

* Predicting the price of a stock

* Predicting the demand for a product

* Estimating the amount of rain


**Question 3**. In linear regression, the least squares method is used to

* Determine whether the target is categorical or numerical.

* Determine how to partition the data into training and test sets.

* Determine the distance between two pairs of samples.

* **Determine the regression line that best fits the samples.**


**Question 4**. How does simple linear regression differ from multiple linear regression?

* In simple linear regression, the input has only categorical variables. In multiple linear regression, the input can be a mix of categorical and numerical variables.

* **In simple linear regression, the input has only one variable. In multiple linear regression, the input has more than one variables.**

* In simple linear regression, the input has only categorical variables. In multiple linear regression, the input has only numerical variables.

* They are the just different terms for linear regression with one input variable.


**Question 5**. The goal of cluster analysis is

* **To segment data so that differences between samples in the same cluster are minimized and differences between samples of different clusters are maximized.**

* To segment data so that all categorical variables are in one cluster, and all numerical variables are in another cluster.

* To segment data so that all samples are evenly divided among the clusters.

* To segment data so that differences between samples in the same cluster are maximized and differences between samples of different clusters are minimized.


**Question 6**. Cluster results can be used to

* Determine anomalous samples

* Create labeled samples for a classification task

* Classify new samples

* Segment the data into groups so that each group can be analyzed further

* **All of these choices are valid uses of the resulting clusters.**


**Question 7**. A cluster centroid is

* **The mean of all the samples in the cluster**

* The mean of all the samples in the two closest clusters.

* The mean of all the samples in all clusters

* The mean of all the samples in the two farthest clusters.


**Question 8**. The main steps in the k-means clustering algorithm are

* **Assign each sample to the closest centroid, then calculate the new centroid.**

* Calculate the distances between the cluster centroids, then find the two closest centroids.

* Calculate the centroids, then determine the appropriate stopping criterion depending on the number of centroids.

* Count the number of samples, then determine the initial centroids.


**Question 9**. The goal of association analysis is

* To find the number of outliers in the data

* To find the number of clusters for cluster analysis

* To find the most complex rules to explain associations between as many items as possible in the data.

* **To find rules to capture associations between items or events**


**Question 10**. In association analysis, an item set is

* **A transaction or set of items that occur together**

* A set of items that two rules have in common

* A set of items that infrequently occur together

* A set of transactions that occur a certain number of times in the data


**Question 11**. The support of an item set

* Captures how many times that item set is used in a rule

* **Captures the frequency of that item set**

* Captures the correlation between the items in that item set

* Captures the number of items in that item set


**Question 12**. Rule confidence is used to

* **Prune rules by eliminating rules with low confidence**

* Measure the intuitiveness of a rule

* Determine the rule with the most items

* Identify frequent item sets
