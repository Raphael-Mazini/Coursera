## Model Evaluation
<br>

_Correct answers are in **bold**._
<br>

**Question 1**. A model that generalizes well means that

* The model is overfitting.

* The model performs well on data used to adjust its parameters.

* The model does a good job of fitting to the noise in the data.

* **The model performs well on data not used in training.**


**Question 2**. What indicates that the model is overfitting?

* High training error and low generalization error

* High training error and high generalization error

* Low training error and low generalization error

* **Low training error and high generalization error**


**Question 3**. Which method is used to avoid overfitting in decision trees?

* Post-pruning

* None of these

* Pre-pruning

* **Pre-pruning and post-pruning**


**Question 4**. Which of the following best describes a way to create and use a validation set to avoid overfitting?

* k-fold cross-validation

* leave-one-out cross-validation

* **All of these**

* random sub-sampling


**Question 5**. Which of the following statements is NOT correct?

* The validation set is used to determine when to stop training the model.

* The training set is used to adjust the parameters of the model.

* The test set is used to evaluate model performance on new data.

* **The test set is used for model selection to avoid overfitting.**


**Question 6**. How is the accuracy rate calculated?

* Divide the number of true positives by the number of true negatives.

* **Divide the number of correct predictions by the total number of predictions**

* Add the number of true positives and the number of false negatives.

* Subtract the number of correct predictions from the total number of predictions.


**Question 7**. Which evaluation metrics are commonly used for evaluating the performance of a classification model when there is a class imbalance problem?

* accuracy and error

* **precision and recall**

* precision and accuracy

* precision and error


**Question 8**. How do you determine the classifier accuracy from the confusion matrix?

* Divide the sum of all the values in the confusion matrix by the total number of samples.

* Divide the sum of the diagonal values in the confusion matrix by the sum of the off-diagonal values.

* **Divide the sum of the diagonal values in the confusion matrix by the total number of samples.**

* Divide the sum of the off-diagonal values in the confusion matrix by the total number of samples.
