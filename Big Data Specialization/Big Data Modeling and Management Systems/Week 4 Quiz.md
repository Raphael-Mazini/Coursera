## Data Formats and Streaming Data Quiz
<br>

_Correct answers are in **bold**._
<br>

**Question 1**. What is true between data modeling and the formatting of the data?

* **The data does not necessarily need to be formatted in a way that represents the data model. Just so long as it can be extrapolated.**

* There is a one to one correspondence between formatting data and data modeling. For every model of data, there is only one way to store the data.

* There is always one specific schema for storing model data that is the best and preferred method for the specific data representation.


**Question 2**. What is streaming?

* Using static data stored from a real time source in order to process and guide the application.

* Using sensors to manipulate the system, such as a smart car being able to drive by itself using sensors to detect road hazards.

* **Utilizing real time data to compute and change the state of an application continuously.**

* Calculating results using real time data otherwise known as streaming data.


**Question 3**. Of the following, what best describes the properties of working with streaming data?

* Data is always utilized for streaming the application.

* **Does not ping the source interactively for a response upon receiving the data.**

* **Independent computations that do not rely on previous or future data.**

* Always unbounded in sequence, in other words, data is not guaranteed to be in order.

* **Data manipulation is near real time.**

* **Small time windows for working with data.**


**Question 4**. What is a characteristic of streaming data?

* The data is unbounded in size and the size determines the time and space of processing the data.

* Data is finite in size and size determines the time and space of processing the data.

* **Data is unbounded in size but requires only finite time and space to process it.**

* The data is finite and requires only finite time and space to process the data.


**Question 5**. What type of algorithm is required for analyzing streaming data?

* Fast and Complex

* **Fast and Simple**

* Accurate and Memory Efficient

* Accurate and Consistent


**Question 6**. What is lambda architecture?

* A specific hardware architecture for a server made specifically for processing real time data.

* **A method to process streaming data by utilizing batch processing and real time processing.**

* A specific method for processing streaming data using special real time processes.


**Question 7**. Of the following, which best represents the challenge regarding the size and frequency of data?

* There may not be data to produce the notion of size and frequency.

* The size and frequency of the streaming data may be too small.

* **The size and frequency of the streaming data may be sporadic.**


**Question 8**. What is the difference between data lakes and data warehouses?

* **Data lakes house raw data while data warehouses contain pre-formatted data.**

* Data lakes utilize hierarchical systems while data warehouses use object storage.

* Data lakes contain only files while data warehouses contain only databases.


**Question 9**. What is schema-on-read?

* The process where data is pre-formatted prior to being read but the schema is loaded on read.

* The process where formatted data is given structure when read.

* Another name for data lakes.

* **Data is stored as raw data until it is read by an application where the application assigns structure.**
