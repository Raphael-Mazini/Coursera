**Question 4**. Based on the videos, which kinds of analysis might one be able to perform on a tweet graph?

* **find interacting groups of users**

* **find influencers in a twitter community**

**Question 5**. The key reason mentioned in the video that biology applications need Big Data analytics is...

* The new use of computational techniques to explore new areas of biology research more quickly than can be done with "live" or wetlab experiments.

* The complexity of interactions that correlate to inform phenotypes.

* **The integration of multiple data sources from different researchers and of different sources of information.**
