**Question 3**. What are mediated schemas?

* **Schema created from integrating two or more schemas.**

* A type of probabilistic schema mapping.

**Question 8**. What do we mean when we say "the true value of a data item"?

* **Extrapolated data from a data item that represents the worth of that item.**

* Data created from statistical estimations.

* Another term for data fusion.
