**Question 4**. What does the following line of code do in postgres?

SELECT count(userid) FROM (SELECT buyclicks.userId, teamLevel, price FROM buyclicks JOIN gameclicks on buyclicks.userId = gameclicks.userId) temp WHERE price=3 and teamLevel=5;

* **Finds the total number of user ids (repeats allowed) in buy-clicks that have bought items with prices worth $3 and was in a team with level 5 at some point in time.**
