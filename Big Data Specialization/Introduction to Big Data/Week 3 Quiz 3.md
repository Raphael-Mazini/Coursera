**Question 1**. Download the text to Alice's Adventures in Wonderland from http://www.gutenberg.org/files/11/11-0.txt (If it redirects you to a page with a welcome popup, click on the "Plain Text UTF-8" option on that page or just download the attachment below) and run wordcount on it. This can be done by using hadoop commands. How many times does the word Cheshire occur? (Do not include the word 'Cheshire with an apostrophe. The string 'Cheshire does not count)

alice.txt

Enter a number:
**6**

**Question 2**. The set of example MapReduce applications includes wordmedian, which computes the median length of words in a text file. If you run wordmedian using words.txt (the Shakespeare text) as input, what is the median word length?

_Note that wordmedian prints the median length to the terminal at the end of the MapReduce job; the output file does not contain the median length._
